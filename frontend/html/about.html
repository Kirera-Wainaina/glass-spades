      <h1>Glass Spades</h1>

      <p>Glass Spades is a real estate agency that embraces the 21st
	century and all the expectations that come with it. We want
	our clients to have the best experience we can deliver. We
	give you:
      </p>

      <div id="easy-access-section">
	<img src="/frontend/images/easy-access.png"
	     alt="easy-access"
	     id="easy-access-img"/>
	<h2>1) Easy access to our representatives</h2>
	<p>It is really frustrating to try and talk to a business
	  representative, whether to gather more information or
	  schedule a meeting only to get no one on the other end of
	  the line. We are always available to help you and if by any
	  chance you don't get us, we will reach out to you as soon as
	  possible.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div id="quality-photos-section">
      <img src="/frontend/images/quality-photos.png"
	   alt="quality"
	   id="quality-photos-img" />
	<h2>2) High quality photos</h2>
	<p>When shopping for your next home on the internet, you hope
	  to get as much relevant information as possible. Your home
	  is one of the most important decisions that you'll make and
	  we will help you make the right one. On our website, each of
	  the houses you look at will have as many photos as we
	  thought you would require to have a clear picture of the
	  house.
	  </p>
      </div>

      <div id="relevant-section">
	<img src="/frontend/images/relevant-description.png"
	     alt="Relevant description"
	     id="relevant-description.png" />
	<h2>3) Relevant descriptions</h2>
	<p>It is one thing to be looking at pictures and it is another
	  to make out what they really represent. It can be a bit
	  confusing especially when the house has a lot of
	  pictures. This is where descriptions come in; they give you
	  context. We keep our descriptions short and informative.
	</p>
      </div>

      <div id="your-side-section">
	<img src="/frontend/images/your-side.png"
	     alt="Your side"
	     id="your-side.png" />
	<h2>4) We are on your side</h2>
	<p>We refuse to believe we are just a real estate agency. We
	  refuse to believe it is just a house. We refuse to believe
	  that you are just a customer. It is more than just
	  business. We endeavor to understand what it is you are
	  really looking for and aid in your getting it. We work
	  within our capacity to deliver on your next home.
