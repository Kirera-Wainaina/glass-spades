About us
========

Glass Spades is a real estate agency that embraces the 21st
century and all the expectations that come with it. We want our
clients to have the best experience we can deliver. We will approach
it in the following ways:

1) Easy access to our representatives
It is really frustrating to try and talk to a business representative,
whether to gather more information or schedule a meeting only to get
no one on the other end of the line. We promise to be there when it
counts.

2) High quality photos
When shopping for your next home on the internet, you hope to get as
much relevant information as possible. Your home is one of the most
important decisions that you'll make and we will help you make the
right one. On our website, each of the houses you look at will have as
many photos as we thought you would require to have a clear picture of
the house. We promise to give you a clear representation of houses.

3) Relevant descriptions
It is one thing to be looking at pictures and it is another to make
out what they really represent. It can be a bit confusing especially
when the house has a lot of pictures. This is where descriptions come
in; they give you context. We promise to give you descriptions and
details that matter.

4) We are on your side
We refuse to believe we are just a real estate agency. We refuse to
believe it is just a house. We refuse to believe that you are just a
customer. It is more than just business. We endeavor to understand
what it is you are really looking for and aid in your getting it. We
promise to be on your side.

We promise to keep our promises!
